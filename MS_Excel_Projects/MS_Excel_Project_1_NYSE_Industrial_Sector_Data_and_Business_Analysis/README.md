# NYSE Business & Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this project I analyzed real life data from New York Stock Market Exchange.  I drew a subset of a large dataset provide by Kaggle on [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data. Next, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the industrial sector companies. I performed that by:

- Interpreting the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range.)

- Using a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data 
validation, VLOOKUP).

- Analyzing and forecasting financial business metrics using Excel.

- Visualizing of the business metric (Revenue) and using Excel charts to make financial model.
