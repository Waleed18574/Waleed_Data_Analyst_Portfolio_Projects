# NYSE Business & Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this project I analyzed real life data from New York Stock Market Exchange. I drew a subset of a large dataset provide by Kaggle that contaiins historical financial data. Next,
I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth 
prospects for the industrial sector companies. I performed that by:

- Interpreting the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range.)

- Using a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data 
validation, VLOOKUP).

- Analyinge and forecasting financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.

- visualizing of the business metric (Revenue) and using Excel charts to make financial model.
