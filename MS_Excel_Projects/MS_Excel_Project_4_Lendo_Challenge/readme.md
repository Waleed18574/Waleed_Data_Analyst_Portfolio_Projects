# Lendo  Test

Months ago, I had applied for one of the largest startup companies in the Gulf. Next, I received an email from them with a test instructions to prove my skills as a data analyst. The test consisted of 3 tasks and one of them is this project. For this task, I was provided with an starting Excel file and a pdf file contained a set of instructions to be executed on the Excel file.
