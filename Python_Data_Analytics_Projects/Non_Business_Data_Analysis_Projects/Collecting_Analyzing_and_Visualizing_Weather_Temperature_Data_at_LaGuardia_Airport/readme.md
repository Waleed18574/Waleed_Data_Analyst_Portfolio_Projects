# Collecting_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Weather_Temperature_Data_at_LaGuardia_Airport
____
## Introduction:
### In this project, I made a request to collect daily temperature data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) API using request library. Next, I explored, manipulated and transformed the data to the required form before analyzing it using pandas library. Finally, I visualized the results of the analysis using plotly library.The [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access) has a helpful getting started page that shows how to form requests.
