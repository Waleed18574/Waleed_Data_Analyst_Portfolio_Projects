# Lendo Test Challenge
Months ago, I had applied for one of the largest startup companies in the Gulf. Next, I received an email from 
them with a test instructions to prove my skills as a data analyst. The test consisted of 3 tasks through 
which I used MS Excel, MS Power BI and Tableau. I cleared the 3 tasks, however, it turns out that the job is 
only for the Saudi citizens. I have no hard feelings as that is their right. I publish this project just to 
show my Data Analytics skills.

## Task 1: COVID Analysis
In this task I was given a dataset of COVID infections across multiple countries and asked to show whcich 
countries have done better over time. I perfromed the task and built a dashboard in Excel, Power BI and 
Tableau.

## Task2: Airlines Delay Analysis in USA
In this task, I was given a dataset of airlines flights in the United States including info about number, 
length, and type of delays over several months. I was asked to provide recommendations to CEO of the Startup
